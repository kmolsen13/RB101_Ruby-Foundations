Naming things
> Make names descriptive and readable. Don't try to save on characters.


Methods
> Make methods short: around 10 lines or so. If it's more than 15 lines, split into 2-3 methods
> Don't both display output and return a meaningful value (Ruby always returns something, but
  if it is meaningful, don't also output something)
> Methods should be at the same level of abstraction. The first three methods below do this: 
  - deal()
  - hit()
  - stay()
  - iterate_through_car    <= this method is at a different level of abstraction: how vs. what
> Method names should reflect mutation (update_total)
> Methods that display things should be named to indicate this: e.g. print_x, display_x
> get_ace(cards) rather than get_ace_from_cards(cards). The latter will make a reader think there are other ways to get an ace
> Don't mutate a collection while iterating through it
  - You can mutate the elements in a collection while interating, but not the collection itself
> Don't use assignment in a conditional
