1.  - ask the user for the first integer
    - get the first integer
    - ask the user for the second integer
    - get the second integer
    - add the two integers together and assign the sum to a variable
    - print the variable
    
    
2.  - create an empty new array
    - iterate through the array of strings
    - on each iteration add the current string to a new array
    - print the new array


3.  - create an empty new array
    - iterate through the array of integers with an index number + 1
    - use a conditional statement to determine when the index is odd
    - if the index is odd, add the corresponding integer to the new array 
    - print the new array


4.  - get a character from the user  
    - create a counter
    - iterate through the array of characters with index number
    - at each occurrence of the given character increment the counter
    - use a conditional statement to determine when the third occurrence of the character is
    - if the counter hits three, return the index number
    - if the counter doesn't hit three, return nil
    
  
5.  - create an empty new array
    - determine the combined length of the two arrays
    - iterate through the numbers up to the length of the two arrays with an index
    - if the index + 1 is odd, use the number from the first array and if the index is odd use the number from the second array
    - add the numbers to the new array
    - print the new array
